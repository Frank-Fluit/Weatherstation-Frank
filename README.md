# Weather Station

## Intro Project

This project has been set up to prepare for a working assignment which will use the Python Django framework, Python package Numpy and te Python Package Panda's in the context of hydrology. Greating an entire hydrological models seems a lit to ambitous, so as a result has been decided to create a simple weather station application, where can be practiced with all relevant technologies.

The goal of this project is to build a simple web application where users can fill in their own personal weather observations. This data can then be used to perform various operations on such as statistical analyses, generating visualizations, and compare their data to data input by other users. This application should work with users accounts and the data should be saved in a database.  

## MoSCoW

### Musts
Users can fill in temperature data
Users fill in location data
Basic statistical information will be given to the users
Users can make their own accounts
Data will be stored in the database
Data should be validated on realistic ranges (such as no temperature above 55 C in NL )

### Shoulds 
Weather trends should be visualised
Fancy visualizations
More advanced analyses regressions etc.
Users can input csv files
Users should be able to customize a short user profile
Generate general weather report

### Coulds
Make a map visualization that shows the locations of all visualisations
Users can add comments to their visualisations
Download historical data to validate data
Download weather reports


### Woulds/Wont's:
Sharing data reports on social media
implement real time weather status
implement machine learning predictions



## Details Software Stack/ Architecture

- Domain is implemented in Python
- Testing utility has to be decided still
- The Backend has been implemented using the Django framework with support for MSQL databases
- The frontend will be implemented either using a separate server or using the template functionality of django
- The database will be created using MYSQL Workbench in MYSQL



## Persoonlijk Leerdoelen (proces)
- Meer zelfstandig werken?
- Het grote plaatje in het oog blijven houden


## Technisch Leerdoel (tools, frameworks, etc.):
- Ervaring opdoen met het Django framework
- Ervaring opdoen met een Python project
- Ervaring opdoen met numpy & pandas packages
